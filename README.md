## Features  

## Models  
> Member  
- This is the Member model, creates library member using their name, email and
  phone with the member_id being generated automatically using uuid
```
 class Member(models.Model):
      member_id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
      name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      email = models.EmailField()
      phone = models.CharField(max_length=80)

      def __str__(self):
              return f'{self.name}'

      class Meta:
      	ordering = ['name']

     def get_absolute_url(self):
           return reverse(
           'soma:member_detail',
           args=[str(self.member_id)]
           )
```  

> Book  
- The book model with multiple fields, the status field is set as available by
  default to signify the book is available for borrowing  
- The borrower is a foreign key of the Member model to show which member
  borrowed which book establishing a relationship between book and member  

```
class Book(models.Model):
    class BookStatus(models.TextChoices):
        AVAILABLE = "AV", _("Available")
        UNAVAILABLE = "UN", _("Unavailable")

    book_id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    year = models.IntegerField()
    genre = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    summary = models.TextField()
    date_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    date_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    status = models.CharField(
            max_length=2,
            choices=BookStatus.choices,
            default=BookStatus.AVAILABLE,
            )
    cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    borrower = models.ForeignKey(
            Member,
            on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
            null=True,
            blank=True
            )

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.title}'

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['title']

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('soma:book_detail', args=[str(self.book_id)])
```  

> BookTransaction  
- This model helps keep track of books issued and books returned  
- It based on the days a book was returned calculates how much the member owes
  the library
- It uses the Book and Member as foreign keys  

```  
class BookTransaction(models.Model):
    member = models.ForeignKey(
            Member,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            related_name='member_transaction'
            )
    book = models.ForeignKey(
            Book,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            related_name='book_transaction'
            )
    date_borrowed = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    date_returned = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, null=True)
    returned = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    total_cost = models.DecimalField(
            max_digits=5,
            decimal_places=2,
            blank=True,
            null=True
            )
    borrowed_days = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.borrowed_days = self.calc_borrowed_days()
        self.total_cost = self.calc_total_cost(self.borrowed_days)

        self.member.cost_incurred = self.total_cost

        super(BookTransaction, self).save(*args, **kwargs)

    def calc_borrowed_days(self):
        if self.date_borrowed is not None:
            if self.date_returned:
                return (self.date_returned - self.date_borrowed).days
            else:
                return (timezone.now() - self.date_borrowed).days
        else:
            return None

    def calc_total_cost(self, borrowed_days):
        cost_per_day = self.book.cost
        return cost_per_day * borrowed_days

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.member.name} borrowed {self.book.title}'

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['date_borrowed']

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('soma:transaction_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
```
